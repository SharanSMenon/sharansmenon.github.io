In this tutorial, you will learn how to implement
decision trees and random forests. Both Decision trees and Random forests can be used for classification and regression. We will use it today for classification. Let's get started!

## Getting started and importing libraries

Let's import all the libraries that we need to make a Decision Tree and a Random Forest. We will be using `scikit-learn` for our models. We will also use scikit learn to generate our data.

### Installing scikit-learn

```sh
pip install scikit-learn
```

> Make sure that you have pandas and numpy installed. You can also install matplotlib for data visualization.
